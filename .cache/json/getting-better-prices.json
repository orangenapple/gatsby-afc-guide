Approximately 5 billion litres of milk are produced each year with the vast majority (over 80%) produced by small-holder farmers. </p>\n<p>That means <strong>small scale farmers are the backbone of production</strong>‚Ä¶</p>\n<h2>What are my options to sell?</h2>\n<p>As a dairy farmer your concern will be how to get the best price. Anne asks the key question:</p>\n<blockquote style=\"background: #6EA6A2;\">\n<h3>Anne‚Äôs Question</h3>\n<p>Hi farmers, lets talk about where our milk ends up. - Dairy Societies, milk bars, hotels, schools, industries etc.\n<br></br>\nWhat are the challenges and how can we help each other market our milk and maximize profits. Those with ideas of supply chains, how can we all benefit?\n<br></br></p>\n<div>\n    Posted by: \n    <img style=\"height:3.2em; border-radius: 2em; border: 1px solid #ffff\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/afc-dairytrial/Anne-K2.png\">\n    <b>Anne K</b>\n    <div style=\"float: right;margin-top:0px;\"> <b>76</b>\n        <a href=\"#\">\n            <img style=\"height:3.2em; border-radius: 2em;\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/afc-dairytrial/clap_btn.jpg\">\n        </a>\n    </div>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It‚Äôs important to note there are multiple avenues. For example, many consider Co-operatives‚Ä¶</p>\n<blockquote style=\"background: #96e58e;\">\n<h3>Stephen supports Co-ops</h3>\n<p>I make an effort to supply my co-op with all my milk but they can only have 2 collections while we have 3 milking so I have a side buyer for the evening collection.\n<br></br>\nI have been working with co-ops and researching too. For a co-op to process ideally you need to have 20-25k kgs per day for it to make economic sense.\n<br></br>\nAnother angle is that we have too many co-ops in central and rift competing unnecessarily. Nyandarua county has realised this and their co-ops are bulking individually but they will be processing together. This works well for Meru Dairy which is a collection of 26 dairies\n<br></br></p>\n<div>\n    Posted by:\n    <img style=\"height:3.2em; border-radius: 2em; border: 1px solid #ffff\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/afc-dairytrial/stephen_k.jpg\">\n    <b>Stephen K</b>\n    <div style=\"float: right;margin-top:0px;\"><b>57</b>\n        <a href=\"#\">\n            <img style=\"height:3.2em; border-radius: 2em;\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/afc-dairytrial/clap_btn.jpg\">\n        </a>\n    </div>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Milk vendors may allow farmers to get closer to the end consumer.

Shown below:</p>\n<img style=\"width: 100%;\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/afc-dairytrial/valuechainimage.png\">\n<p>The size of the bands shows the volume of milk flow. So you can see that most production is consumed directy (for home consumtion or direct sales). Most of the collection and bulking is handled by Co-ops or Self-help groups.</p>\n<h2>What‚Äôs going on near me?</h2>\n<p>We aim to collect locations for every single co-op, cooler, dairy and processor in the country.
