### Reason 4 - NOT ENOUGH MINERALS

Does your dairy cow‚Äôs skin look shiny and healthy? If not then your cow may be lacking essential minerals.
<br></br>
You can buy granular mineral salts from any agrovet and mix them in with the feeds. Dr Muchibi from Elgon Kenya suggests: ‚ÄúProvide mineral salts at a rate of 150g for every 5 litres of milk produced, and an extra 60g for every 5 extra litres.‚Äù
<br></br>
You can also buy mineral licks which you should make easily accessible so your cow can use the lick whenever she wants.

### Top Q&A from AFC members

John asked a key question relevant to many farmers...

<blockquote style="background: #6EA6A2;">

  ### John's Question

  Good morning farmers we started a dairy unit last week with 2 cows each doing about 6 liters per day. So far the cows have not improved in terms of milk production even after feeding them on 14KG silage, 3KG oat hay, 2Kg dairy meal (Unga) and a lot of clean and fresh drinking water. What can we do to improve the cows in terms of production?

Halbe suggests adding more protein to the diet in the form of pure soy meal...

<blockquote style="background: #96e58e;">

### Halbe's Answer

You feed 15 kg of silage, which is around 5 kg dry matter. The hay is around 2.5 kg of dry matter. The total dry matter intake from fodder is than 7.5 kg. This is very is low. An adult HF cow easily eats 12 kg dry matter of fodder. Our starting point is always that a cow eats plenty of fodder (as much as they can eat). Then a cow will eat 9 kgdm of silage (25 kg product) and 3 kg oat hay. I think the oat hay is very low in protein. The silage is also low in protein (5%) Cows need 14% protein as a minimum, so to compensate your lack of protein (7.5 kgdm x 80 = 560 gram protein) your 2 kg of unga should have 280 gram protein extra. Together with the standard 14% the unga should contain 400gram protein. So you should feed pure soy meal.

There may be a less obvious reason for low milk production and that is stress...

<blockquote style="background: #D7F19F;">

### Reason 4 - STRESS

Many farmers report that cows that are calm, happy and comfortable produce more milk. Providing a more comfortable and stress-free environment is a very cheap way of increasing your milk production.

There are 3 main factors that might be causing your dairy cows stress.
1. Heat or cold stress ‚Äì caused by very hot or cold weather
2. Environmental stress ‚Äì caused by uncomfortable housing, poor cleaning of the cow shed or cows being transported
3. Psychological stress ‚Äì remember that to produce a good amount of milk cows need to feel safe and calm. When you milk a cow you need to be gentle and soothing. Treating a cow roughly, lots of loud noises or being around other stressed animals will reduce your milk production.

### Real Farmer Stories

Check out David's experience with increasing milk production by making his cows more comfortable...

  "The key to continuous improvement of your dairy farm is regular observation of your herd and attention to any slight discomfort you come across. For instance in our farm, we observed that the hard surface at the milking parlor was making the cows very restless and at times they'd kick off the milking equipment. We decided to put a mat for them to be stepping on and the results are amazing. You might as well go for your cup of tea as you patiently wait for your milk"

### Reason 5 - OTHER ISSUES

A sudden drop in milk production could be a sign that your cow is unwell. If you see a sudden change in milk production and you have not changed your feeding or milking process then we recommend you get your cow checked with a vet asap.
