### Reason 4 - NOT ENOUGH MINERALS

Does your dairy cow‚Äôs skin look shiny and healthy? If not then your cow may be lacking essential minerals.
<br></br>
You can buy granular mineral salts from any agrovet and mix them in with the feeds. Dr Muchibi from Elgon Kenya suggests: ‚ÄúProvide mineral salts at a rate of 150g for every 5 litres of milk produced, and an extra 60g for every 5 extra litres.‚Äù
<br></br>
You can also buy mineral licks which you should make easily accessible so your cow can use the lick whenever she wants.

### Top Q&A from AFC members

Joseph asked a key question regarding minerals...

<blockquote style="background: #6EA6A2;">

  ### Joseph's Question

  Helloooo farmers.... Some one gave me this idea of giving mineral lick adlib to my five dairy cows instead of using the 100-200grm measure per cow per day.... The argument is each cow will lick what it feels is enough just like they drink water.... Need some professional advice....

Patrick explains the advantages and disadvantages of the different mineral feeding methods...

<blockquote style="background: #96e58e;">

### Patrick's Answer

Minerals and vitamins has two approach while feeding and both has its own advantage and disadvantage. 
<br><br>
One is adlib feeding - its most ideal but faces more challenges:
1. If minerals are not palatable cows will experience deficiencies and more wastages hence loss to a farmer.
2. Some of raw materials used are highly soluble thus when come into contact with saliva or water they are lost.
3. Due to the pecking order some cows might not be able to access minerals.
4. If its highly palatable within short duration its over hence more cost to farmer and advantageous to cows.

Force feeding/regulated feeding - this one a farmer is sure the quantity offered and cows have consumed it but challenge is:
1. Will cow requirement be met? if no then deficiencies.
2. Is manufacturer quoted measure per cow per day honest with it or is there to please farmer on economic sense? If no then expect deficiencies.
3. On farmer weighing how is the accuracy rate?

My point of view that I opt for, definitely its open to factual critiques is:
1. Have a mineral block
2. on average a dairy cow needs 5-6kgs of minerals per month. Have 2kgs (40%) adlib and 3kgs (60%) regulated feeding.

Based on cows need advice from your dairy expert is ideal. Manufacturer advice is also good to adhere to since they know raw materials used.

There may be a less obvious reason for low milk production and that is stress...

<blockquote style="background: #D7F19F;">

### Reason 4 - STRESS

Many farmers report that cows that are calm, happy and comfortable produce more milk. Providing a more comfortable and stress-free environment is a very cheap way of increasing your milk production.

There are 3 main factors that might be causing your dairy cows stress.
1. Heat or cold stress ‚Äì caused by very hot or cold weather
2. Environmental stress ‚Äì caused by uncomfortable housing, poor cleaning of the cow shed or cows being transported
3. Psychological stress ‚Äì remember that to produce a good amount of milk cows need to feel safe and calm. When you milk a cow you need to be gentle and soothing. Treating a cow roughly, lots of loud noises or being around other stressed animals will reduce your milk production.

### Real Farmer Stories

Check out David's experience with increasing milk production by making his cows more comfortable...

  "The key to continuous improvement of your dairy farm is regular observation of your herd and attention to any slight discomfort you come across. For instance in our farm, we observed that the hard surface at the milking parlor was making the cows very restless and at times they'd kick off the milking equipment. We decided to put a mat for them to be stepping on and the results are amazing. You might as well go for your cup of tea as you patiently wait for your milk"

### Reason 5 - OTHER ISSUES

A sudden drop in milk production could be a sign that your cow is unwell. If you see a sudden change in milk production and you have not changed your feeding or milking process then we recommend you get your cow checked with a vet asap.
